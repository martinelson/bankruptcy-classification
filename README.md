# bankruptcy-classification

This project is a classification modeling practice project utilizing a bankruptcy dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction

I go through various classification techniques in the python notebook such as KNN, PCA, Random Forest/Gradient Boosting, which can be viewed in the HTML file.
